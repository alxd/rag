1. **Voluntary and Involuntary Actions**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Aristotle distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary actions to determine moral responsibility. Voluntary actions are those for which an individual is morally responsible, while involuntary actions are not.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Those things, then, are thought involuntary, which take place under compulsion or owing to ignorance; and that is compulsory of which the moving principle is outside, being a principle in which nothing is contributed by the person who is acting or is feeling the passion"" (Book III, 1).

2. **Choice (Prohairesis)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Choice is a fundamental concept in Aristotle's ethics, as it is the basis for voluntary actions and moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""The origin of action—its efficient, not its final cause—is choice, and that of choice is desire and reasoning with a view to an end"" (Nicomachean Ethics/93).

3. **Practical Wisdom (Phronesis)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Practical wisdom is the intellectual virtue that enables individuals to make the right choices and act virtuously, which is essential for moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Practical wisdom is a right rule about such matters. Socrates, then, thought the virtues were rules or rational principles (for he thought they were, all of them, forms of scientific knowledge), while we think they involve a rational principle"" (Nicomachean Ethics/105).

4. **Habituation (Ethos)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Habituation is the process by which individuals develop virtues and vices, which in turn affects their moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""From this it is also plain that none of the moral virtues arises in us by nature; for nothing that exists by nature can form a habit contrary to its nature"" (Book II, 1).

5. **Virtue (Arete)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Virtue is the state of character that enables individuals to act in accordance with reason and achieve eudaimonia (happiness), which is the ultimate goal of moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching (for which reason it requires experience and time), while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit"" (Book II, 1).

6. **Passions (Pathē)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Passions are the emotions and desires that can influence an individual's actions and moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Since virtue is concerned with passions and actions, and on voluntary passions and actions praise and blame are bestowed, on those that are involuntary pardon, and sometimes also pity, to distinguish the voluntary and the involuntary is presumably necessary for those who are studying the nature of virtue"" (Book III, 1).

7. **Moral Virtues**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Moral virtues are the habits that enable individuals to act in accordance with reason and achieve eudaimonia, which is the ultimate goal of moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""The virtues we get by first exercising them, as also happens in the case of the arts as well. For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them, e.g., men become builders by building and lyreplayers by playing the lyre; so too we become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts"" (Nicomachean Ethics/22).

8. **Punishment and Reward**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Punishment and reward are the consequences of moral responsibility, which motivate individuals to act virtuously.
   - **Specific Use**: ""The work of both the intellectual parts, then, is truth. Therefore the states that are most strictly those in respect of which each of these parts will reach truth are the virtues of the two parts"" (Nicomachean Ethics/93).

9. **Moral Luck**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Moral luck refers to the idea that individuals can be morally responsible for actions that are beyond their control, which is a complex issue in Aristotle's ethics.
   - **Specific Use**: ""The question might be asked, what we mean by saying that we must become just by doing just acts, and temperate by doing temperate acts; for if men do just and temperate acts, they are already just and temperate, exactly as, if they do what is in accordance with the laws of grammar and of music, they are grammarians and musicians"" (Nicomachean Ethics/25).

10. **Moral Character (Ethos)**:
    - **Reason for Selection**: Moral character is the disposition that enables individuals to act virtuously and be morally responsible.
    - **Specific Use**: ""The excellence of the reason is a thing apart; we must be content to say this much about it, for to describe it precisely is a task greater than our purpose requires"" (page_content='8).

   - **Significance**: Understanding injustice is essential for comprehending moral responsibility, as it involves acting contrary to the right rule.

10. **Pleasure and Pain**:
    - **Selection Reason**: Aristotle discusses the role of pleasure and pain in moral decision-making, noting that virtues are concerned with the right amount of pleasure and pain. He states, ""Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching... while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit"" (Book II, 2).
    - **Significance**: Pleasure and pain influence moral choices, and understanding their role is crucial for moral responsibility.

2. **Choice (Prohairesis)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Choice is a fundamental concept in Aristotle's ethics, as it is the origin of action and is linked to moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""The origin of action—its efficient, not its final cause—is choice, and that of choice is desire and reasoning with a view to an end"" (page_content='The origin of action—its efficient, not its final cause—is choice,\nand that of choice is desire and reasoning with a view to an end. This is\nwhy choice cannot exist either without reason and intellect or without a\nmoral state; for good action and its opposite cannot exist without a\ncombination of intellect and character. Intellect itself, however, moves\nnothing, but only the intellect which aims at an end and is practical; for\nthis rules the productive intellect, as well, since every one who makes\nmakes for an end, and that which is made is not an end in the unqualified\nsense (but only an end in a particular relation, and the end of a particu-\nlar operation)—only that which is done is that; for good action is an\nend, and desire aims at this. Hence choice is either desiderative reason\nor ratiocinative desire, and such an origin of action is a man. (It is to\nbe\n\x0cNicomachean Ethics/93\n\nnoted that nothing that is past is an object of choice, e.g., no one chooses\n\nto have sacked Troy; for no one deliberates about the past, but about\nwhat is future and capable of being otherwise, while what is past is not\ncapable of not having taken place; hence Agathon is right in saying\n\nFor this alone is lacking even to God, To make undone things thathave\n\nonce been done.)').

3. **Practical Wisdom (Phronesis)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Practical wisdom is essential for making the right choices and acting virtuously, which is a key aspect of moral responsibility.

But in this way we may also refute the dialectical\nargument whereby it might be contended that the virtues exist in separa-\ntion from each other; the same man, it might be said, is not best equipped\nby nature for all the virtues, so that he will have already acquired one\nwhen he has not yet acquired another. This is possible in respect of the\nnatural virtues, but not in respect of those in respect of which a man is\ncalled without qualification good; for with the presence of the one qual-\nity, practical wisdom, will be given all the virtues. And it is plain that,\neven if it were of no practical value, we should have needed it because it\nis the virtue of the part of us in question; plain too that the choice will\nnot be right without practical wisdom any more than without virtue; for\nthe one deter, mines the end and the other makes us do the things that\nlead to the end.').

7. **Passions (Pathē)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Passions are emotional states that can influence moral responsibility, and Aristotle discusses how they should be managed through virtues.
   - **Specific Uses**:
     - ""That moral virtue is a mean, then, and in what sense it is so, and that it is a mean between two vices, the one involving excess, the other deficiency, and that it is such because its character is to aim at what is intermediate in passions and in actions, has been sufficiently stated"" (Book II, 6).
     - ""For the man who abstains from bodily pleasures and delights in this very fact is temperate, while the man who is annoyed at it is self-indulgent"" (Book III, 3).

     - ""The justice in transactions between man and man is a sort of equality indeed, and the injustice a sort of inequality"" (Book V, 4).

9. **Injustice (Adikia)**:

0.5,0.1,50,0.6,🇪🇺 Mistral-API,"Based on the provided context, here are the key concepts describing criteria for moral responsibility in Aristotle's ethics, along with explanations and specific uses of those terms:

1. **Moral Choice (Prohairesis)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Aristotle emphasizes that moral responsibility is closely tied to moral choice, which is a deliberate decision made by an individual. Moral choice is voluntary and involves the agent's rational deliberation.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Now Moral Choice is neither independent of intellect, i.e. intellectual operation, nor of a certain moral state: for right or wrong action cannot be, independently of operation of the Intellect, and moral character.""

2. **Voluntary Actions**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Voluntary actions are those that are done with knowledge and intention, and thus are subject to moral evaluation. Involuntary actions, done under compulsion or ignorance, are not considered morally responsible.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Involuntary actions then are thought to be of two kinds, being done neither on compulsion, or by reason of ignorance.""

3. **Intellect (Nous)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: The intellect plays a crucial role in moral responsibility by providing the principles and reasoning that guide moral choice. It is the faculty that apprehends moral truths.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Of the good man it is true likewise that he does many things for the sake of his friends and his country, even to the extent of dying for them, if need be: for money and honours, and, in short, all the good things which others fight for, he will throw away while eager to secure to himself the καλὸν: he will prefer a brief and great joy to a tame and enduring one, and to live nobly for one year rather than ordinarily for many, and one great and noble action to many trifling ones.""

4. **Habit (Ethos)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Habits are formed through repeated actions and are essential for the development of moral character. They shape an individual's dispositions and tendencies, making them more or less inclined to act virtuously.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Again, in whatever cases we get things by nature, we get the faculties first and perform the acts of working afterwards; an illustration of which is afforded by the case of our bodily senses, for it was not from having often seen or heard that we got these senses, but just the reverse: we had them and so exercised them, but did not have them because we had exercised them.""

5. **Virtue (Arete)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Virtues are habits that dispose individuals to act in accordance with reason and moral principles. They are essential for moral responsibility because they enable individuals to make the right moral choices.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Virtue then is ‘a state apt to exercise deliberate choice, being in the relative mean, determined by reason, and as the man of practical wisdom would determine.’""

6. **Practical Wisdom (Phronesis)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Practical wisdom is the intellectual virtue that enables individuals to make the right moral choices in particular situations. It involves the ability to apply general moral principles to specific cases.

   - **Reason for Selection**: Self-control is the virtue that enables individuals to resist temptations and act in accordance with their moral principles, even when faced with strong desires or emotions.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Again, he who fails when exposed to those temptations against which the common run of men hold out, and are well able to do so, is Soft and Luxurious (Luxury being a kind of Softness): the kind of man, I mean, to let his robe drag in the dirt to avoid the trouble of lifting it.""

8. **Incontinence (Akrasia)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Incontinence refers to the lack of self-control, where individuals know what is right but fail to act on it due to strong desires or emotions. It is a form of moral weakness that affects moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""But the man of Imperfect Self-Control is almost made up of remorse: and so the case is not as we determined it before, but the former is incurable and the latter may be cured: for depravity is like chronic diseases, dropsy and consumption for instance, but Imperfect Self-Control is like acute disorders: the former being a continuous evil, the latter not so.""

9. **Ignorance (Agnoia)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Ignorance can affect moral responsibility by excusing individuals from blame when they act without knowledge of the moral principles involved. However, ignorance of moral principles themselves is not a valid excuse.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Again, we do not usually apply the term involuntary when a man is ignorant of his own true interest; because ignorance which affects moral choice constitutes depravity but not involuntariness: nor does any ignorance of principle (because for this men are blamed) but ignorance in particular details, wherein consists the action and wherewith it is concerned, for in these there is both compassion and allowance, because he who acts in ignorance of any of them acts in a proper sense involuntarily.""

10. **Passion (Pathos)**:
    - **Reason for Selection**: Passions are strong emotions that can influence moral choice and action. They can either enhance or hinder moral responsibility, depending on how they are managed.
    - **Specific Use**: ""Furthermore, to the character of Imperfect Self-Control is opposed that of Self-Control, and to that of Softness that of Endurance: because Endurance consists in continued resistance but Self-Control in actual mastery, and continued resistance and actual mastery are as different as not being conquered is from conquering; and so Self-Control is more choice-worthy than Endurance.""

   - **Specific Use**: ""But when actions are done, either from fear of greater evils, or from ignorance of the circumstances, they are involuntary.""

9. **Moral Virtues and Vices**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: The presence of moral virtues or vices in an individual's character determines their moral responsibility for actions.
   - **Specific Use**: ""The Doctrine of the Mean here takes a form in which it has impressed subsequent thinkers, but which has less importance than is usually ascribed to it.""

10. **Moral Sense (Aisthesis)**:
    - **Reason for Selection**: The moral sense is the faculty that perceives moral principles and guides moral actions, making it essential for moral responsibility.
    - **Specific Use**: ""Again, in right of the Feelings we are neither praised nor blamed, (for a man is not commended for being afraid or being angry, nor blamed for being angry merely but for being so in a particular way), but in right of the virtues and vices we are.""

3. **Intent (βούλησις)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Intent refers to the purpose or goal behind an action. It is essential for determining moral responsibility because it shows the agent's will and deliberation.
   - **Specific Use**: ""But operation of the Intellect by itself moves nothing, only when directed to a certain result, i. e. exercised in Moral Action: (I say nothing of its being exercised in production, because this function is originated by the former: for every one who makes makes with a view to somewhat further; and that which is or may be made, is not an End in itself, but only relatively to somewhat else, and belonging to some one: whereas that which is or may be done is an End in itself, because acting well is an End in itself, and this is the object of the Will,)"" (Book VI, Chapter II)

   - **Reason for Selection**: Knowledge is crucial for moral responsibility because it enables the agent to understand the moral implications of their actions and make informed decisions.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Again, we do not usually apply the term involuntary when a man is ignorant of his own true interest; because ignorance which affects moral choice constitutes depravity but not involuntariness: nor does any ignorance of principle (because for this men are blamed) but ignorance in particular details, wherein consists the action and wherewith it is concerned, for in these there is both compassion and allowance, because he who acts in ignorance of any of them acts in a proper sense involuntarily.""

But the Virtues we get by first performing single acts of working, which, again, is the case of other things, as the arts for instance; for what we have to make when we have learned how, these we learn how to make by making: men come to be builders, for instance, by building; harp-players, by playing on the harp: exactly so, by doing just actions we come to be just; by doing the actions of self-mastery we come to be perfected in self-mastery; and by doing brave actions brave."" (Book II, Chapter I)

6. **Deliberation (βουλεύσις)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Deliberation is the process of reasoning and considering different courses of action. It is a key criterion for moral responsibility because it shows the agent's rational engagement with their choices.
   - **Specific Use**: ""But nothing which is done and past can be the object of Moral Choice; for instance, no man chooses to have sacked Troy; because, in fact, no one ever deliberates about what is past, but only about that which is future, and which may therefore be influenced, whereas what has been cannot not have been: and so Agathon is right in saying 'Of this alone is Deity bereft, To make undone whatever hath been done.'""

2. **Voluntary Actions**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Voluntary actions are those that are performed with knowledge and intention, making the agent morally responsible for their outcomes.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Involuntary actions then are thought to be of two kinds, being done neither on compulsion, or by reason of ignorance. An action is, properly speaking, compulsory, when the origination is external to the agent, being such that in it the agent (perhaps we may more properly say the patient) contributes nothing.""

3. **Intellect (Nous)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: The intellect plays a crucial role in moral responsibility by providing the principles and reasoning necessary for moral choice.

But the Virtues we get by first performing single acts of working, which, again, is the case of other things, as the arts for instance.""

   - **Reason for Selection**: Deliberation is the process of reasoning about the means to achieve a moral end, which is essential for moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""But operation of the Intellect by itself moves nothing, only when directed to a certain result, i.e. exercised in Moral Action: (I say nothing of its being exercised in production, because this function is originated by the former: for every one who makes makes with a view to somewhat further; and that which is or may be made, is not an End in itself, but only relatively to somewhat else, and belonging to some one.""

10. **Moral Character (Ethos)**:
    - **Reason for Selection**: Moral character is the result of habituation and virtue, determining an individual's moral responsibility.
    - **Specific Use**: ""But it must not be supposed that every action or every feeling is capable of subsisting in this mean state, because some there are which are so named as immediately to convey the notion of badness, as malevolence, shamelessness, envy; or, to instance in actions, adultery, theft, homicide; for all these and suchlike are blamed because they are in themselves bad, not the having too much or too little of them.""

   - **Specific Use**: ""Again, the man utterly destitute of Self-Control, as was observed before, is not given to remorse: for it is part of his character that he abides by his moral choice: but the man of Imperfect Self-Control is almost made up of remorse: and so the case is not as we determined it before, but the former is incurable and the latter may be cured.""

6. **Deliberation (Boulēsis)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Deliberation is the process by which individuals consider the means to achieve their ends, which is essential for making morally responsible decisions.
   - **Specific Use**: ""So it seems, as has been said, that Man is the originator of his actions; and Deliberation has for its object whatever may be done through one’s own instrumentality, and the actions are with a view to other things; and so it is, not the End, but the Means to Ends on which Deliberation is employed.""

7. **Moral Virtues and Vices**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Moral virtues and vices are the dispositions that guide individuals' actions and determine their moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Virtue then is “a state apt to exercise deliberate choice, being in the relative mean, determined by reason, and as the man of practical wisdom would determine.”""

8. **Ignorance and Responsibility**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Aristotle discusses different types of ignorance to determine when individuals are morally responsible for their actions.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Again, we do not usually apply the term involuntary when a man is ignorant of his own true interest; because ignorance which affects moral choice constitutes depravity but not involuntariness.""

9. **Moral Principles and Rules**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Moral principles and rules provide the guidelines for moral action and are essential for understanding how individuals exercise moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""The rule prescribes the control and regulation within limits of the agent’s natural impulses to act and feel thus and thus.""

10. **Moral Sense (Aisthesis)**:
    - **Reason for Selection**: The moral sense is the faculty that enables individuals to perceive moral truths and act accordingly, which is crucial for moral responsibility.
    - **Specific Use**: ""It is not thought that choosing and opining best always go together, but that some opine the better course and yet by reason of viciousness choose not the things which they should.""

0.5,0.95,50,0.5,🇪🇺 Mistral-API,"Based on the provided context, here are the key concepts describing criteria for moral responsibility in Aristotle's ethics, along with explanations and specific uses of those terms:

1. **Voluntary and Involuntary Actions**:
   - **Selection Reason**: Aristotle distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary actions to determine moral responsibility. Voluntary actions are those for which the agent is responsible, while involuntary actions are not.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Involuntary actions then are thought to be of two kinds, being done neither on compulsion, or by reason of ignorance. An action is, properly speaking, compulsory, when the origination is external to the agent, being such that in it the agent (perhaps we may more properly say the patient) contributes nothing."" (Book III, Chapter I)

2. **Moral Choice (Prohairesis)**:
   - **Selection Reason**: Moral choice is a deliberate decision that reflects the agent's character and is a key criterion for moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Now Moral Choice is plainly voluntary, but the two are not co-extensive, voluntary being the more comprehensive term; for first, children and all other animals share in voluntary action but not in Moral Choice."" (Book III, Chapter I)

3. **Knowledge and Ignorance**:
   - **Selection Reason**: Knowledge of the moral rule is essential for moral responsibility. Ignorance can extenuate responsibility but only in specific cases.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Again, we do not usually apply the term involuntary when a man is ignorant of his own true interest; because ignorance which affects moral choice constitutes depravity but not involuntariness."" (Book III, Chapter V)

4. **Passion and Emotion**:
   - **Selection Reason**: Passions and emotions can affect moral responsibility by influencing actions. However, they do not excuse moral responsibility entirely.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Again, there is a character liable to be taken off his feet in defiance of Right Reason because of passion; whom passion so far masters as to prevent his acting in accordance with Right Reason, but not so far as to make him be convinced that it is his proper line to follow after such pleasures without limit."" (Book VII, Chapter VIII)

5. **Habituation and Virtue**:
   - **Selection Reason**: Habituation and the development of virtues are crucial for moral responsibility as they shape the agent's character.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Again, in whatever cases we get things by nature, we get the faculties first and perform the acts of working afterwards; an illustration of which is afforded by the case of our bodily senses, for it was not from having often seen or heard that we got these senses, but just the reverse: we had them and so exercised them, but did not have them because we had exercised them. But the Virtues we get by first performing single acts of working."" (Book II, Chapter I)

6. **Deliberation**:
   - **Selection Reason**: Deliberation is the process of reasoning about the means to achieve a moral end, and it is essential for moral responsibility.

7. **Self-Control (Enkrateia) and Akrasia (Incontinence)**:
   - **Selection Reason**: Self-control and incontinence are states that affect moral responsibility by determining the agent's ability to act according to moral principles.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Again, he who fails when exposed to those temptations against which the common run of men hold out, and are well able to do so, is Soft and Luxurious (Luxury being a kind of Softness): the kind of man, I mean, to let his robe drag in the dirt to avoid the trouble of lifting it.""

8. **Practical Wisdom (Phronesis)**:
   - **Selection Reason**: Practical wisdom is the ability to make good judgments about what is right and good, and it is necessary for moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Practical Wisdom is concerned with things that are good or bad for man; it is a rational quality, concerned with action and contingent matters."" (Book VI, Chapter V)

9. **Moral Virtues and Vices**:
   - **Selection Reason**: Moral virtues and vices are habits that determine the agent's character and moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Virtue then is a state apt to exercise deliberate choice, being in the relative mean, determined by reason, and as the man of practical wisdom would determine."" (Book II, Chapter VI)

10. **Justice (Dikaiosyne)**:
    - **Selection Reason**: Justice is a moral virtue that involves treating others fairly and is a key criterion for moral responsibility in social interactions.
    - **Specific Use**: ""Justice is the moral state in virtue of which the just man is said to have the aptitude for practising the Just in the way of moral choice, and for making division between, himself and another, or between two other men, not so as to give to himself the greater and to his neighbour the less share of what is choice-worthy and contrariwise of what is hurtful, but what is proportionably equal, and in like manner when adjudging the rights of two other men.""

(Book III, Chapter I)

2. **Moral Choice (Prohairesis)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Moral choice is central to Aristotle's ethics because it involves the deliberate selection of actions based on reason and character.
   - **Specific Use**: ""Now Moral Choice is plainly voluntary, but the two are not co-extensive, voluntary being the more comprehensive term; for first, children and all other animals share in voluntary action but not in Moral Choice; and next, sudden actions we call voluntary but do not ascribe them to Moral Choice.""

3. **Intellect and Will**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: The interaction between intellect and will is crucial for understanding how moral responsibility is formed and exercised.
   - **Specific Use**: ""What in the Intellectual operation is Affirmation and Negation that in the Will is Pursuit and Avoidance, And so, since Moral Virtue is a State apt to exercise Moral Choice and Moral Choice is Will consequent on deliberation, the Reason must be true and the Will right, to constitute good Moral Choice, and what the Reason affirms the Will must pursue.""

4. **Habituation and Virtue**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Habituation is the process by which virtues are formed, making individuals morally responsible for their actions.
   - **Specific Use**: ""By doing just actions we come to be just; by doing the actions of self-mastery we come to be perfected in self-mastery; and by doing brave actions brave."" (Book II, Chapter I)

5. **Self-Control (Enkrateia) and Incontinence (Akrasia)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: These concepts describe the struggle between reason and desire, which is essential for understanding moral responsibility.

(Book VII, Chapter VI)
     - ""But, of the different forms of Imperfect Self-Control, those are better who are carried off their feet by a sudden access of temptation than they who have Reason but do not abide by it."" (Book VII, Chapter VI)

4. **Habituation (Ethos)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Habituation refers to the process of forming moral habits through repeated actions. It is essential for developing moral character and responsibility.

5. **Practical Wisdom (Phronesis)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Practical wisdom is the ability to make good judgments in practical matters, which is essential for moral responsibility. It involves understanding the particular circumstances and acting accordingly.
   - **Specific Uses**:
     - ""And as the poet has it, 'Men may be bad in many ways, But good in one alone.' "" (Book II, Chapter VI)
     - ""But it must not be supposed that every action or every feeling is capable of subsisting in this mean state, because some there are which are so named as immediately to convey the notion of badness, as malevolence, shamelessness, envy; or, to instance in actions, adultery, theft, homicide; for all these and suchlike are blamed because they are in themselves bad, not the having too much or too little of them."" (Book II, Chapter VI)

6. **Virtue (Arete)**:

(Book II, Chapter VI)

7. **Deliberation (Boulēsis)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Deliberation is the process of considering and evaluating different courses of action, which is crucial for making morally responsible decisions.
   - **Specific Uses**:
     - ""Now the starting-point of moral action is Moral Choice, (I mean, what actually sets it in motion, not the final cause), and of Moral Choice, Appetition, and Reason directed to a certain result: and thus Moral Choice is neither independent of intellect, i.e. intellectual operation, nor of a certain moral state: for right or wrong action cannot be, independently of operation of the Intellect, and moral character.""

     - ""Again, we do not usually apply the term involuntary when a man is ignorant of his own true interest; because ignorance which affects moral choice constitutes depravity but not involuntariness: nor does any ignorance of principle (because for this men are blamed) but ignorance in particular details, wherein consists the action and wherewith it is concerned, for in these there is both compassion and allowance, because he who acts in ignorance of any of them acts in a proper sense involuntarily."" (Book III, Chapter V)
     - ""But surely in respect of those whose motive to Friendship is utility or pleasure there can be nothing wrong in breaking up the connection when they no longer have those qualities; because they were friends [not of one another, but] of those qualities: and, these having failed, it is only reasonable to expect that they should cease to entertain the sentiment.""

9. **Passion (Pathos)**:
   - **Reason for Selection**: Passions, such as anger or desire, can influence moral actions. Understanding how passions affect moral choices is essential for assessing moral responsibility.
   - **Specific Uses**:
     - ""But, of the different forms of Imperfect Self-Control, those are better who are carried off their feet by a sudden access of temptation than they who have Reason but do not abide by it; these last being overcome by passion less in degree, and not wholly without premeditation as are the others: for the man of Imperfect Self-Control is like those who are soon intoxicated and by little wine and less than the common run of men."" (Book VII, Chapter VI)
     - ""Again, the man utterly destitute of Self-Control, as was observed before, is not given to remorse: for it is part of his character that he abides by his moral choice: but the man of Imperfect Self-Control is almost made up of remorse: and so the case is not as we determined it before, but the former is incurable and the latter may be cured: for depravity is like chronic diseases, dropsy and consumption for instance, but Imperfect Self-Control is like acute disorders: the former being a continuous evil, the latter not so."" (Book VII, Chapter VI)

10. **Moral Virtues and Vices**:
    - **Reason for Selection**: Moral virtues and vices are the qualities that determine an individual's moral character and responsibility. They are the result of habituation and practical wisdom.
